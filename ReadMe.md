# Board Cutter

A simple program to help determine how to cut wooden boards to the correct length economically in the workshop.

Just list the sizes you need and the sizes of your sources and away you go.

This does not use an exhaustive algorithm or necessarily provide the untilmate efficiency, the method used simply iterates through cutting the biggest pieces possible from the the smallest boards and ends up with not too much waste.

So far it has worked well for me, and I can use the printout in the shop.
